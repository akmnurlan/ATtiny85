# ATTINY85 Digispark kickstarter miniature for Arduino usb development

Download Arduino IDE.

You also need to download and run the DPinst64.exe and Install Drivers.exe from Digistump.Drivers.zip that I shared.

Additonally, I added these links in Arduino IDE:

File > Preferences > Additional boards manager URLs: 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digistump/arduino-boards-index/refs/heads/master/package_digistump_index.json

However It still says unrecognized USB device in Device Manager, my ATtiny85 works well, and I can upload codes inside it.

Then choose this :
